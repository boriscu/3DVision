3D object.

Each vertex has coordinates (x, y, z) that define its position.\n","3. **Faces**: These are made up of three or more vertices connected together. They form the visible surfaces of the mesh. Faces are not colors; they are more like the shape sections that make up the outer shell of the object.\n","\n","### Example\n","Imagine we're creating a model of a pyramid. The vertices would be the corners of the pyramid:\n","\n","    Vertex A at the top (0, 1, 0)\n","    Vertex B at one base corner (-1, 0, -1)\n","    Vertex C at another base corner (1, 0, -1)\n","    Vertex D at the third base corner (1, 0, 1)\n","    Vertex E at the fourth base corner (-1, 0, 1)\n","\n","The faces would be the triangular sides that connect these vertices:\n","\n","```\n","Face 1: connects vertices A, B, C (forming one side of the pyramid)\n","Face 2: connects vertices A, C, D (forming another side)\n","Face 3: connects vertices A, D, E (and another)\n","Face 4: connects vertices A, E, B (completing the sides)\n","Face 5: connects vertices B, C, D, E (forming the base)\n","```\n","\n","In the code, the faces are indeed just a set of vertices. Specifically, they are represented by indices that point to the vertices in the verts tensor. Each entry in the faces object refers to a group of vertices that together form a polygon, typically a triangle in many 3D models.\n","In PyTorch 3D, the faces object has a few components, but the key one we're using is faces.verts_idx. This is a tensor of indices where each row corresponds to a face, and each column in a row refers to the index of a vertex in the verts tensor. By using these indices, you can form the geometric shape of each face by connecting the vertices specified by these indices.\n","For example, if verts contains:\n","```\n","[[1, 1, 1],\n"," [2, 2, 2],\n"," [3, 3, 3]]\n","```\n","and faces.verts_idx contains:\n","```\n","[[0, 1, 2]]\n","\n","```\n","This means there is one face in the mesh, and it is a triangle formed by connecting the vertices at positions 0, 1, and 2 in the verts tensor (i.e., the points (1,1,1), (2,2,2), and (3,3,3))."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8eya_vrRMEPo"},"source":["## Code"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"T-XovFtlvU_a"},"outputs":[],"source":["trg_obj = 'Bush1.obj'"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"XAi6RowTvXDx"},"outputs":[],"source":["# We read the target 3D model using load_obj\n","verts, faces, aux = load_obj(trg_obj)\n","\n","# verts is a FloatTensor of shape (V, 3) where V is the number of vertices in the mesh\n","# faces is an object which contains the following LongTensors: verts_idx, normals_idx and textures_idx\n","# For this tutorial, normals and textures are ignored.\n","faces_idx = faces.verts_idx.to(device)\n","verts = verts.to(device)\n","\n","# We scale normalize and center the target mesh to fit in a sphere of radius 1 centered at (0,0,0).\n","# (scale, center) will be used to bring the predicted mesh to its original center and scale\n","# Note that normalizing the target mesh, speeds up the optimization but is not necessary!\n","center = verts.mean(0)\n","verts = verts -
